Plan for the future 2.0:
1. Make a hashamp with a stack like in tic tac toe, for like the first five moves. 
2. Make a function that counts the permanent corners.
3. Make a functino that for each permenant corner, it counts how many connecting spaces you have with no gaps.
4. Make several eval functions and play them against each other to figure out which one is better 
 *** Ph-Pa = permanent pieces wieghed more
 *** P(oH-oA) = nonpermanent pieces wieghed less
